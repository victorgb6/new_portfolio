description: This web was a volunteer project for a local painters association. The idea behind this site was to build a website where members at the association were able to upload their latest paints and create galleries. I decided to use Wordpress because it's open source and easy to use. I created a custom theme for them and use a gallery plugin so they can manage the galleries in the back-end.
