description: 'This was a pet project that I did for myself. The idea came when I was trying to watch online a football match and I wanted to listen to the radio instead of the tv commentators. So I develop this website where you can select between different radio stations and add the dealy you desire. It suddenly becomes quite a success and the site has around 30.000 page views per month. For the development I used Zurb Foundation as a CSS framework and Gulp as task runner to compile and build it.'
