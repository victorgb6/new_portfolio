description: 'Virtual Center 360 is an online platform designed for companies, where they are able to manege all their communications in one place with special attention to their customer care service. Virtual Center 360 has won several awards like "Best Web Navigation Project" in 2012 and 2013 or "Best Solution for Resources Optimization" in 2014. The platform uses HTML, CSS and Javascript for the front-end part and PHP and Nodejs in the back-end. I was responsible of all the front-end part including new developments and functionalities, like the ICD (Intelligence Cloud Dialer) a fully automatic dialer, and to mantain and correct any bug or problem. In the new design of the platform I was starting to use AngularJS as javascript framework, this way we were able to write cleaner, testable and fastest code.'
