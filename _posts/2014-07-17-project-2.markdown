description: 'I did this project when I was an internship for KS-Agency. The objective was to develop all the HTML and CSS from a static design and adapt it to work with Drupal as CMS. In addition the project requires a lubricants finder section, so I have to populate a SQL database and develop a search section to explore it.'
